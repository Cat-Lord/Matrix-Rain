This is a simple program simulating Matrix Rain (also called Matrix Rain Code) in Javascript. There was no optimization done.
I changed the intial behaviour of the rain, so there might be redundant code.

The rain starts just by opening the page.html.
If you click, you can stop the execution at any time.
